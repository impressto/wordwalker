## Key Concepts

### What is localStorage?
- Browser API for device storage (not network)
- ~5-10MB capacity per domain
- Works online AND offline
- Persists across sessions
- Used by: Web apps, PWAs, games

### What is a Service Worker?
- Runs in background
- Caches app assets
- Enables offline gameplay
- Intercepts network requests
- Already implemented in WordWalker

### How do they work together?
- Service Worker = Provides offline app shell
- localStorage = Provides game state persistence
- Both work independently
- No conflicts
- Perfect combination for offline gaming

### Why doesn't PWA need changes?
- PWA uses same browser APIs
- localStorage available in PWA
- Service worker same in PWA
- No special code needed
- Automatic compatibility

---

## Technical Stack

### What Works Offline ✅
```
React components         ✅ Local state management
Canvas API             ✅ Graphics rendering
Web Audio API          ✅ Audio playback (cached)
localStorage API       ✅ Device storage (core feature)
Service Worker         ✅ Asset caching
Interval timers        ✅ Timing functions
Animation frames       ✅ Frame timing
Touch/keyboard events  ✅ User input
```

### What Needs Network ❌
```
Fetch API              ❌ (not used in persistence)
Server calls           ❌ (not used in persistence)
External APIs          ❌ (not used in persistence)
Cloud storage          ❌ (not implemented)
```

### Result
```
100% of game functionality works offline ✅
100% of state persistence works offline ✅
0% of code requires network for persistence ✅
```
